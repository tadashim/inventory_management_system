# Inventory Management System

This inventory management system is a simple console-based application for managing a retail store's product inventory. It allows for adding, editing, deleting, and listing products in the inventory.

## Getting Started
Follow these instructions to build and run the inventory management system.

### Prerequisites
To run this system, you need the Rust programming language and Cargo, Rust's package manager and build system. If you don't have Rust set up already, you can install it from [the official Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

### Building

Execute the following command in your command line or terminal:

```
cargo build
```
This will build the project and generate an executable binary.

### Running

This will display the inventory management system menu in the console, allowing you to manage products as per the instructions.

## Features
